                <p>"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"...or NOT!!!
                </p>
                <p>I am passionate about fixing things and making them better. Today, technology (and
                    life) is moving at hyper speed and in order to keep up,
                    you must develop improvements before it is needed. Waiting until something breaks
                    before fixing it is a guaranteed path to obsolescence.
                </p>
                <p>I have 20 plus years of experience in fixing and improving "things" in government and
                    private sectors and have executed innovative solutions
                    to underperforming programs in addition to implementing new projects and procedures.
                    I am currently expanding my skills and knowledge in the technology
                    field and becoming proficient in languages and platforms such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java Script
                    Node.js and React.
                </p>
                <p>Before becoming a web developer, I was a supervisor in charge of operations at the
                    Transportation Security Administration Coordination Center at
                    Salt Lake City International Airport, serving within the Office of Security
                    Operations under the direction of Homeland Security. I was reponsible for
                    managing and supervising Coordination Center officers in addition to collaborating
                    with local, state and federal agencies to ensure operational security programs
                    are properly applied and implemented. I also developed and implemented multiple
                    procedural changes to improve efficiency, increase teamwork and improve morale,
                    and fascilitated training to ensure that the officers are utilizing available
                    technology to its fullest potential.
                </p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy gardening, cooking, playing the piano and giving back to
                    the community with volunteer work.
